This project is related to the previous one named "WebScrapping." This application collects essential data about French startups, including the name of the coordinator, the domain, the name of the startup, 
the number of likes, and the link to their websites. It also visualizes some results using histograms and other charts. 
The application detects the number of likes using machine learning regression algorithms.
For web scraping, I used Selenium and BeautifulSoup, and the information was stored in an Excel file. For the machine learning algorithms, I used Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Tree Regressor, 
and Random Forest. After calculating the mean squared error (MSE) for each, Linear Regression was found to be the best-performing algorithm.
